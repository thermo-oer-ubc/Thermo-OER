    "Consider a refrigeration cycle using R134-a as the coolant to provide $100\\:kW$ of cooling load to a cold storage. The refrigerant absorbs heat at $-20^{\\circ}  C$ during evaporation and enters the compressor as a saturated vapor. The compressor is coupled to a gas turbine operating with compressed air, which provides power to the compressor, pressurizing R134a and increasing its temperature to $120^{\\circ}  C$. The refrigerant is then cooled down to a saturated liquid at $40^{\\circ}  C$ in the condenser at constant pressure before entering a throttling valve. The refrigerant is then throttled to $-20^{\\circ}  C$ and enters the evaporator. Given that the turbine operates with compressed air at $1\\:MPa$ gauge pressure and room temperature, determine the air flow-rate required to provide the required cooling load if the air is discharged to the atmosphere at the turbine outlet and goes through a polytropic process with $n=1.5$.
