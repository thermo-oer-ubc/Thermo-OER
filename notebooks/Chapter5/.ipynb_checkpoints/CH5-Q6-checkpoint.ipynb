                "Consider a refrigeration cycle working with R134-a as coolant to support $100\\:kW$ of cooling load to a cold storage. The refrigerant absorbs heat at $-20^{\\circ}  C$ during evaporation and enters the compressor as saturated vapor. The compressor is coupled to a gas turbine working with compressed air that pressurizes R134-a increasing the coolant's temperature to $120^{\\circ}  C$. The refrigerant is then cooled down to saturated liquid at $40^{\\circ}  C$ in a condensor in constant pressure before entering a throttling valve. The refrigerant is then throttled to $-20^{\\circ}  C$ to provide refrigerating fluid for the evaporator. Given the turbine works with compressed air at $1\\:MPa$ gauge pressure and room temperature, determine the air flow-rate required to provide the required cooling load given the air is discharged to the atmosphere at the turbine outlet and goes through a polytropic process with $n=1.5$.
