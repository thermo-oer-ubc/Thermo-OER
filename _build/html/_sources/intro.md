# Open Education Resources (OER): Introduction to Engineering Thermodynamics

This is a project that extends the original e-textbook written by Dr. Claire Yu Yan in UBC Okanagan campus:[Introduction to Engineering Thermodynamics](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/thermo1). The main goals for this project are as follows:

(i) To provide students with a list of questions that can be done in their laptops with the help of some Python packages such as CoolProp, numpy and matplotlib. 

(ii) To reinforce the concepts learnt from e-textbook and to get a better appreciation of how to use digital tools to do perform thermodynamic calculations.

(iii) To provide a starting point for Thermodynamics courses in other disciplines to adopt a more computational approach for their courses.
