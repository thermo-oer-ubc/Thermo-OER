    "# 4.1: Piston-cylinder: isothermal expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "A cylinder fitted with a frictionless piston contains 1 kg of oxygen gas at an initial temperature of 20°C \n",
    "and a volume of 0.8 m³. The gas undergoes an isothermal expansion until its volume doubles. \n",
    "During the process, the cylinder is in thermal contact with a heat reservoir at 20°C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the following:\n",
    "1. The specific boundary work done by the oxygen gas during the expansion.\n",
    "2. The amount of heat transferred to the gas during this process.\n",
    "3. Assuming the specific internal energy of oxygen changes due to the process, calculate the change in specific internal energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculations, assume that oxygen behaves as an ideal gas and use its specific properties. \n",
    "Also, consider that the process is isothermal, meaning the temperature remains constant throughout the process.\n",
    "## Solution:"
