    "Consider a refrigeration cycle using R134-a as the working fluid. The refrigerant absorbs heat at $-20 ^{\\circ}  C$ during evaporation and enters the compressor as a saturated vapor. The compressor then pressurizes R134-a until its temperature increases to $120 ^{\\circ}  C$. The refrigerant is then cooled down to a saturated liquid at $40 ^{\\circ}  C$ at constant pressure in a heat exchanger before entering a throttling valve. The refrigerant is throttled to $-20 ^{\\circ}  C$ then enters the evaporator. Assuming the refrigerant rejects heat to pressurized water in the heat exchanger, heating the water from room temperature to saturated vapor at $110 ^{\\circ}  C$, calculate the amount of water per kg of R134a to support cooling power in the heat exhanger."
